00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,190
the high school are not fully online
with the connection to the solar panel

1324
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
with the connection to the solar panel
 

1325
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,509
with the connection to the solar panel
grid. So you don't have um we need at

1326
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
grid. So you don't have um we need at
 

1327
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,669
grid. So you don't have um we need at
least a year's worth of data to know how

1328
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:11,679
least a year's worth of data to know how
 

1329
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,830
least a year's worth of data to know how
much we had typically budgeted for

1330
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:13,840
much we had typically budgeted for
 

1331
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,990
much we had typically budgeted for
ultimately into how much we're saving.

1332
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,000
ultimately into how much we're saving.
 

1333
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,149
ultimately into how much we're saving.
But we do we did see a substantial

1334
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:18,159
But we do we did see a substantial
 

1335
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,630
But we do we did see a substantial
reduction in utility savings with that.

1336
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
reduction in utility savings with that.
 

1337
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,789
reduction in utility savings with that.
We don't have a full year's worth of all

1338
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:22,799
We don't have a full year's worth of all
 

1339
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,549
We don't have a full year's worth of all
of the components because we're not

1340
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:24,559
of the components because we're not
 

1341
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,070
of the components because we're not
fully completed. Um part of the EPC is

1342
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
fully completed. Um part of the EPC is
 

1343
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,750
fully completed. Um part of the EPC is
um the district gets what's known as an

1344
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,760
um the district gets what's known as an
 

1345
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,909
um the district gets what's known as an
MNV measurement and verification

1346
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:31,919
MNV measurement and verification
 

1347
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,509
MNV measurement and verification
guaranteed for three years by the

1348
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:33,519
guaranteed for three years by the
 

1349
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,630
guaranteed for three years by the
contractor. Obviously once the

1350
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:36,640
contractor. Obviously once the
 

1351
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,470
contractor. Obviously once the
completion is fully completed that

1352
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,480
completion is fully completed that
 

1353
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,549
completion is fully completed that
starts the clock of the three years. So

1354
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
starts the clock of the three years. So
 

1355
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,750
starts the clock of the three years. So
obviously because we're not fully

1356
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:41,760
obviously because we're not fully
 

1357
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,149
obviously because we're not fully
completed we have not begun that point.

1358
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
completed we have not begun that point.
 

1359
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,789
completed we have not begun that point.
Is it possible to say that during the

depending on the exposure to the sun uh
 

1373
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,230
depending on the exposure to the sun uh
and and how much is built up and Mr.

1374
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
and and how much is built up and Mr.
 

1375

Transom I know you can help me with this

1376
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
Transom I know you can help me with this
 

1377
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,470
Transom I know you can help me with this
um it it does depend but that has been

1378
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
um it it does depend but that has been
 

1379
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,149
um it it does depend but that has been
um a reality for sure.

1380
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
um a reality for sure.
 

1381
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,909
um a reality for sure.
So that can that Mr.

1382
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
So that can that Mr.
 

1383
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,310
So that can that Mr.
Yes, you actually could. Uh, but we'd

1384
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,320
Yes, you actually could. Uh, but we'd
 

1385
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,710
Yes, you actually could. Uh, but we'd
have to set it up so we can test it over

1386
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,720
have to set it up so we can test it over
 

1387
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,510
have to set it up so we can test it over
two months or so. So, we have to be able

1388
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:15,520
two months or so. So, we have to be able
 

1389
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,310
two months or so. So, we have to be able
to gather the data because it we did

1390
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
to gather the data because it we did
 

1391
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,589
to gather the data because it we did
prove it with the uh uh less solar uh uh

1392
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:23,599
prove it with the uh uh less solar uh uh
 

1393
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,750
prove it with the uh uh less solar uh uh
last year. We had an electrical savings

1394
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
last year. We had an electrical savings
 

1395
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,669
last year. We had an electrical savings
that was uh correct me if I'm wrong,

1396
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
that was uh correct me if I'm wrong,
 

1397
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,149
that was uh correct me if I'm wrong,
five or $600,000,

1398
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
five or $600,000,
 

1399
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:32,790
five or $600,000,
something like that.

1400
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:32,800
something like that.
 

1401
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,510
something like that.
Yep.

1402
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:33,520
Yep.
 

1403
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,149
Yep.
So, we know that that little bit is

1404
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,159
So, we know that that little bit is
 

1405
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,230
So, we know that that little bit is
going to be exponentially a lot more

1406
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:38,240
going to be exponentially a lot more
 

1407
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,589
going to be exponentially a lot more
when the middle school and high school

1408
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
when the middle school and high school
 

1409
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,510
when the middle school and high school
go in. It's primarily in the solar, but

1410
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
go in. It's primarily in the solar, but
 

1411
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,470
go in. It's primarily in the solar, but
the weatherization and the lighting was

1412
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
the weatherization and the lighting was
 

1413
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,389
the weatherization and the lighting was
a big savings and that's what's measured

1414
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:46,399
a big savings and that's what's measured
 

1415
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,950
a big savings and that's what's measured
in that 600,000.

1416
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
in that 600,000.
 

1417
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,270
in that 600,000.
That's a that's a significant savings

1418
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:51,280
That's a that's a significant savings
 

1419
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,669
That's a that's a significant savings
and I' I'd bank on that anytime with the

1420
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:53,679
and I' I'd bank on that anytime with the
 

1421
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,510
and I' I'd bank on that anytime with the
money that we spent.

1422
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,520
money that we spent.
 

1423
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,190
money that we spent.
Perfect. Thanks a lot, Mr. Transit. And

1424
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,200
Perfect. Thanks a lot, Mr. Transit. And
 

1425
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:57,589
Perfect. Thanks a lot, Mr. Transit. And
Mr.

Thank you, Mr. Sol.
 

1429
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,630
Thank you, Mr. Sol.
Yeah. Uh Dr. Kley, just to clarify, the

1430
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
Yeah. Uh Dr. Kley, just to clarify, the
 

1431
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,630
Yeah. Uh Dr. Kley, just to clarify, the
beauty of the EPC

1432
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
beauty of the EPC
 

1433
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,990
beauty of the EPC
uh contract was that

1434
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
uh contract was that
 

1435
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,750
uh contract was that
any cost savings that we incurred

1436
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
any cost savings that we incurred
 

1437
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,790
any cost savings that we incurred
because of the contract would go to pay

1438
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:14,800
because of the contract would go to pay
 

1439
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,349
because of the contract would go to pay
the vendors for the cost of making all

1440
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
the vendors for the cost of making all
 

1441
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,069
the vendors for the cost of making all
the upgrades. And then once we're done

1442
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
the upgrades. And then once we're done
 

1443
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,710
the upgrades. And then once we're done
with them, any revenue then goes back

1444
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
with them, any revenue then goes back
 

1445
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,390
with them, any revenue then goes back
into reducing the cost of our operation

1446
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,400
into reducing the cost of our operation
 

1447
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,030
into reducing the cost of our operation
budget.

1448
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,040
budget.
 

1449
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,150
budget.
That is correct. with one um additional

1450
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,160
That is correct. with one um additional
 

1451
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,510
That is correct. with one um additional
benefit

1452
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
benefit
 

1453
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,349
benefit
once. So the project what you're saying

1454
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
once. So the project what you're saying
 

1455
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,109
once. So the project what you're saying
is the project is self- sustaining which

1456
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
is the project is self- sustaining which
 

1457
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,630
is the project is self- sustaining which
you're absolutely the project pays for

1458
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
you're absolutely the project pays for
 

1459
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,150
you're absolutely the project pays for
itself. Ultimately the savings that come

1460
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,160
itself. Ultimately the savings that come
 

1461
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,030
itself. Ultimately the savings that come
from this the the utilities the electric

1462
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
from this the the utilities the electric
 

1463
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,510
from this the the utilities the electric
etc ultimately reduce how much we need

1464
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,520
etc ultimately reduce how much we need
 

1465
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,750
etc ultimately reduce how much we need
to budget in subsequent budget years for

1466
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
to budget in subsequent budget years for
 

1467
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,750
to budget in subsequent budget years for
utility codes. But the additional

1468
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:51,760
utility codes. But the additional
 

1469
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,230
utility codes. But the additional
benefit is because this energy

1470
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
benefit is because this energy
 

1471
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,910
benefit is because this energy

additional building aid which is
approximately 40 cents of the dollar for

1482
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:05,839
approximately 40 cents of the dollar for
 

1483
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:06,630
approximately 40 cents of the dollar for
us.

1484
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:06,640
us.
 

1485
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,470
us.
I just wanted to clarify that for people

1486
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:08,480
I just wanted to clarify that for people
 

1487
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,670
I just wanted to clarify that for people
to understand the the beauty of this EPC

1488
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
to understand the the beauty of this EPC
 

1489
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,230
to understand the the beauty of this EPC
contract. It was a very creative and

1490
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240
contract. It was a very creative and
 

1491
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,510
contract. It was a very creative and
unique idea. Um thank you Dr. Harrington

1492
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
unique idea. Um thank you Dr. Harrington
 

1493
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,349
unique idea. Um thank you Dr. Harrington
for bringing that to us because I think

1494
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
for bringing that to us because I think
 

1495
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,030
for bringing that to us because I think
you discovered some other districts that

1496
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
you discovered some other districts that
 

1497
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,950
you discovered some other districts that
were doing it before us and um it it was

1498
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
were doing it before us and um it it was
 

1499
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,150
were doing it before us and um it it was
a it was really a great suggestion

1500
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
a it was really a great suggestion
 

1501
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,310
a it was really a great suggestion
uh because No, it does. It avoids all

1502
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,320
uh because No, it does. It avoids all
 

1503
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,390
uh because No, it does. It avoids all
these having to bond and all this other

1504
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,400
these having to bond and all this other
 

1505
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,109
these having to bond and all this other
stuff. We're we're doing it slowly, but

1506
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,119
stuff. We're we're doing it slowly, but
 

1507
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,190
stuff. We're we're doing it slowly, but
we're paying for it ourselves through

1508
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,200
we're paying for it ourselves through
 

1509
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,990
we're paying for it ourselves through
our savings.

1510
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,000
our savings.
 

1511
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,910
our savings.
That's correct.

1512
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:39,920
That's correct.
 

1513
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,230
That's correct.
Thank you.

1514
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,240
Thank you.

Yes, thank you. So, um I believe we will
have our numbers up there, but um what I

1530
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
have our numbers up there, but um what I
 

1531
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,150
have our numbers up there, but um what I
do want to point out, this is a report

1532
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,160
do want to point out, this is a report
 

1533
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,069
do want to point out, this is a report
that we make every September obviously

1534
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,079
that we make every September obviously
 

1535
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,589
that we make every September obviously
to give the board and community an

1536
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:03,599
to give the board and community an
 

1537
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,750
to give the board and community an
update where we are comparing to where

1538
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:05,760
update where we are comparing to where
 

1539
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,750
update where we are comparing to where
we were last year at this time.

1540
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,760
we were last year at this time.
 

1541
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,069
we were last year at this time.
Obviously, this is a fluid document. I

1542
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
Obviously, this is a fluid document. I
 

1543
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,910
Obviously, this is a fluid document. I
have to tell you it literally changes

1544
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
have to tell you it literally changes
 

1545
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,950
have to tell you it literally changes
every day. Um we but I look at it on a

1546
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:14,960
every day. Um we but I look at it on a
 

1547
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,390
every day. Um we but I look at it on a
monthly basis. When there are

1548
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,400
monthly basis. When there are
 

1549
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,550
monthly basis. When there are
significant u points that must be made

1550
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
significant u points that must be made
 

1551
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,470
significant u points that must be made
to the board, I will bring it to the

1552
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,480
to the board, I will bring it to the
 

1553
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,109
to the board, I will bring it to the
board. But suffice to say, as you look

1554
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:23,119
board. But suffice to say, as you look
 

1555
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,270
board. But suffice to say, as you look
at this, um, if you look at the just

1556
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:25,280
at this, um, if you look at the just
 

1557
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,270
at this, um, if you look at the just
the, uh, the the top bucket, those are

1558
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
the, uh, the the top bucket, those are
 

1559
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,790
the, uh, the the top bucket, those are
the elementary schools from UPK through

1560
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:30,800
the elementary schools from UPK through
 

1561
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,109
the elementary schools from UPK through
9E. And as you can see, we're two

1562
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
9E. And as you can see, we're two
 

1563
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,109
9E. And as you can see, we're two
students more than we were in the

1564
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
students more than we were in the
 

1565
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,829
students more than we were in the
beginning of September 204. I am going

1566
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
beginning of September 204. I am going
 

1567
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,510
beginning of September 204. I am going
to address the kindergarten numbers at

1568
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:39,520
to address the kindergarten numbers at
 

1569
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,670
to address the kindergarten numbers at
the end of this, but just know um,

1570
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
the end of this, but just know um,
 

1571
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,910
the end of this, but just know um,
pretty much we stayed on track across

1572
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
pretty much we stayed on track across
 

1573
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,310
pretty much we stayed on track across
each and each building. I also want to

1574
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,320
each and each building. I also want to
 

1575
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,829
each and each building. I also want to
remind the board that we had done an

1576
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:47,839
remind the board that we had done an
 

1577
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,829
remind the board that we had done an
enrollment study a number of years ago

1578
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:49,839
enrollment study a number of years ago
 

1579
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,589
enrollment study a number of years ago
and then we did an update to it when we

1580
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
and then we did an update to it when we
 

1581
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,670
and then we did an update to it when we
were doing the capital reserve project.

1582
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
were doing the capital reserve project.
 

1583
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,109
were doing the capital reserve project.
I traced those numbers and I have to say

1584
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
I traced those numbers and I have to say
 

1585
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,670
I traced those numbers and I have to say
in some cases they were spot on like the

1586
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
in some cases they were spot on like the
 

1587
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,069
in some cases they were spot on like the
exact number that they predicted um we

1588
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:02,079
exact number that they predicted um we
 

1589
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,910
exact number that they predicted um we
were going to have in certain schools I

1590
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:03,920
were going to have in certain schools I
 

1591
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,990
were going to have in certain schools I
think nine was the one they got it spot

1592
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
think nine was the one they got it spot
 

1593
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,750
think nine was the one they got it spot
on. I don't know how they do it. But the

1594
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:07,760
on. I don't know how they do it. But the
 

1595
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,829
on. I don't know how they do it. But the
good news is that we made certain

1596
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:09,839
good news is that we made certain
 

1597
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,550
good news is that we made certain
decisions a couple of years ago that we

1598
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:12,560
decisions a couple of years ago that we
 

1599
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,990
decisions a couple of years ago that we
recognized that there were some

1600
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000
recognized that there were some
 

1601
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,750
recognized that there were some
inequities in numbers in our buildings

1602
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:15,760
inequities in numbers in our buildings
 

1603
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,589
inequities in numbers in our buildings
and that's very apparent when you look

1604
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:17,599
and that's very apparent when you look
 

1605
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,710
and that's very apparent when you look
at the the the day the data there, but

1606
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:20,720
at the the the day the data there, but
 

1607
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,030
at the the the day the data there, but
that it wasn't going to grow to a

1608
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
that it wasn't going to grow to a
 

1609
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,470
that it wasn't going to grow to a
problem where we really needed to do

1610
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,480
problem where we really needed to do
 

1611
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,150
problem where we really needed to do
something I'm going to put in quotes

1612
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
something I'm going to put in quotes
 

1613
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,670
something I'm going to put in quotes
drastic in order to deal with the

1614
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,680
drastic in order to deal with the
 

1615
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,310
drastic in order to deal with the
enrollment numbers. So we um we've

1616
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:30,320
enrollment numbers. So we um we've
 

1617
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,710
enrollment numbers. So we um we've
stayed pretty much status quo from last

1618
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
stayed pretty much status quo from last
 

1619
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,390
stayed pretty much status quo from last
year to this year at the elementary

1620
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:34,400
year to this year at the elementary
 

1621
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,310
year to this year at the elementary
level and the middle school are there

1622
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:36,320
level and the middle school are there
 

1623
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,390
level and the middle school are there
was a a little bit of an uptick but that

1624
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
was a a little bit of an uptick but that
 

1625
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,310
was a a little bit of an uptick but that
really just depends on the cohorts that

1626
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,320
really just depends on the cohorts that
 

1627
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,390
really just depends on the cohorts that
actually wind up being in um in the

1628
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
actually wind up being in um in the
 

1629
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,230
actually wind up being in um in the
school at that particular time. But we

1630
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,240
school at that particular time. But we
 

1631
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,390
school at that particular time. But we
now have a middle school of 831

1632
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
now have a middle school of 831
 

1633
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,630
now have a middle school of 831
students. Um which if you know anything

1634
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640
students. Um which if you know anything
 

1635
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,310
students. Um which if you know anything
about middle school students, it's a lot

1647
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,710
little bit of a dip from from um where
we started in September of 24. I will

1648
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:04,720
we started in September of 24. I will
 

1649
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,870
we started in September of 24. I will
say again, I don't have hard data to

1650
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:06,880
say again, I don't have hard data to
 

1651
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,950
say again, I don't have hard data to
back this up, but we do get a number of

1652
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
back this up, but we do get a number of
 

1653
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,550
back this up, but we do get a number of
students that choose to go to private

1654
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
students that choose to go to private
 

1655
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,030
students that choose to go to private
school for their high school years. And

1656
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,040
school for their high school years. And
 

1657
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,349
school for their high school years. And
that's typically what we see. And I have

1658
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
that's typically what we see. And I have
 

1659
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,270
that's typically what we see. And I have
to tell you, somewhere's around

1660
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
to tell you, somewhere's around
 

1661
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,270
to tell you, somewhere's around
December, January, February, all of a

1662
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,280
December, January, February, all of a
 

1663
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,910
December, January, February, all of a
sudden kids start to trickle back in or

1664
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920
sudden kids start to trickle back in or
 

1665
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,390
sudden kids start to trickle back in or
a couple of grades later. But more or

1666
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
a couple of grades later. But more or
 

1667
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,390
a couple of grades later. But more or
less, um that's where we took a little

1668
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
less, um that's where we took a little
 

1669
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,470
less, um that's where we took a little
bit of a dip. Castleton has been

1670
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
bit of a dip. Castleton has been
 

1671
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,790
bit of a dip. Castleton has been
relatively constant. We always start the

1672
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:30,800
relatively constant. We always start the
 

1673
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,270
relatively constant. We always start the
school year with approximately 3540

1674
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,280
school year with approximately 3540
 

1675
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,870
school year with approximately 3540
students. We typically end uh in June

1676
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:36,880
students. We typically end uh in June
 

1677
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,270
students. We typically end uh in June
closer to 50 60 and that's just the

1678
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,280
closer to 50 60 and that's just the
 

1679
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,150
closer to 50 60 and that's just the
nature of of the way that program works

1680
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,160
nature of of the way that program works
 

1681
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,790
nature of of the way that program works
and the process in that regard. So, in

1682
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800
and the process in that regard. So, in
 

1683
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,950
and the process in that regard. So, in
total, in terms of where we are as a

1684
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
total, in terms of where we are as a
 

1685
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,069
total, in terms of where we are as a
district, we began September of 2024

1686
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:50,079
district, we began September of 2024
 

1687
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,470
district, we began September of 2024
with 5,173

1688
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:52,480
with 5,173
 

1689
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,390
with 5,173
students, and we began this September

1690
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,400
students, and we began this September
 

1691
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,950
students, and we began this September
with 5,155

1692
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:56,960
with 5,155
 

1693
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,670
with 5,155
students. So, you know, give or take 20

1694
00:39:59,670 --> 00:39:59,680
students. So, you know, give or take 20
 

1695
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,349
students. So, you know, give or take 20
students. We're still on track to be

1696
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:01,359
students. We're still on track to be
 

1697
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,670
students. We're still on track to be
relatively consistent in terms of our

1698
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:03,680
relatively consistent in terms of our
 

1699
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,230
relatively consistent in terms of our
enrollment. In terms of the breakdowns

1700
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,240
enrollment. In terms of the breakdowns
 

1701
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,550
enrollment. In terms of the breakdowns
by schools, that's the next slide you

1702
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:08,560
by schools, that's the next slide you
 

1703
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,109
by schools, that's the next slide you
see here. Um I think what you want what

1704
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:11,119
see here. Um I think what you want what
 

1705
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,750
see here. Um I think what you want what
speaks um at the elementary level I

1706
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:13,760
speaks um at the elementary level I
 

1707
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,270
speaks um at the elementary level I
think these numbers do speak for

1708
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:15,280
think these numbers do speak for
 

1709
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,750
think these numbers do speak for
themselves in the sense that they also

1710
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:17,760
themselves in the sense that they also
 

1711
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,390
themselves in the sense that they also
match where we've been um in terms of

1712
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
match where we've been um in terms of
 

1713
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,870
match where we've been um in terms of
the enrollment study. So I'm happy about

1714
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:22,880
the enrollment study. So I'm happy about
 

1715
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,829
the enrollment study. So I'm happy about
that. Uh and again consistent across the

1716
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:25,839
that. Uh and again consistent across the
 

1717
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,670
that. Uh and again consistent across the
board in terms of kindergarten.

1718
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:27,680
board in terms of kindergarten.
 

1719
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,109
board in terms of kindergarten.
Something I do want to point out

1720
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,119
Something I do want to point out
 

1721
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,109
Something I do want to point out
publicly. I did have this conversation

1722
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,119
publicly. I did have this conversation
 

1723
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,750
publicly. I did have this conversation
with the PTA as well earlier in the

1724
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:33,760
with the PTA as well earlier in the
 

1725
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,150
with the PTA as well earlier in the
month, but we did see an uptick of

1726
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
month, but we did see an uptick of
 

1727
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,390
month, but we did see an uptick of
kindergarten students that enrolled

1728
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
kindergarten students that enrolled
 

1729
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,390
kindergarten students that enrolled
literally within the last week of

1730
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,400
literally within the last week of
 

1731
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,069
literally within the last week of
school, if not the first couple of days

1732
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
school, if not the first couple of days
 

1733
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,109
school, if not the first couple of days
of school. And that really does set up a

1734
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:45,119
of school. And that really does set up a
 

1735
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,430
of school. And that really does set up a
problem for us because at that point,

1736
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
problem for us because at that point,
 

1737
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,030
problem for us because at that point,
our students have been assigned

1738
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,040
our students have been assigned
 

1739
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,790
our students have been assigned
teachers. The parents and families know

1740
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:50,800
teachers. The parents and families know
 

1741
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,069
teachers. The parents and families know
who the teachers are. uh and to undo

1742
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:54,079
who the teachers are. uh and to undo
 

1743
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,950
who the teachers are. uh and to undo
that is something that um is really not

1744
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:56,960
that is something that um is really not
 

1745
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,030
that is something that um is really not
a practice that we believe is in the

1746
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
a practice that we believe is in the
 

1747
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,550
a practice that we believe is in the
best interest of our students, our

1748
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,560
best interest of our students, our
 

1749
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,910
best interest of our students, our
families or or or or our teachers. So,

1750
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:03,920
families or or or or our teachers. So,
 

1751
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,349
families or or or or our teachers. So,
um we deal with what we what we're

1752
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:05,359
um we deal with what we what we're
 

1753
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,829
um we deal with what we what we're
given. So, the guideline and remember we

1754
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:07,839
given. So, the guideline and remember we
 

1755
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,829
given. So, the guideline and remember we
do have class- size guidelines. We did a

1756
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:09,839
do have class- size guidelines. We did a
 

1757
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,430
do have class- size guidelines. We did a
whole presentation on that in the

1758
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:11,440
whole presentation on that in the
 

1759
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,990
whole presentation on that in the
spring. That presentation still lives on

1760
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,000
spring. That presentation still lives on
 

1761
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,750
spring. That presentation still lives on
our website. You're welcome to take a

1762
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:15,760
our website. You're welcome to take a
 

1763
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,510
our website. You're welcome to take a
look at that. But the guideline for

1764
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
look at that. But the guideline for
 

1765
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,309
look at that. But the guideline for
kindergarten is 22 students. I remind

1766
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:20,319
kindergarten is 22 students. I remind
 

1767
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,790
kindergarten is 22 students. I remind
everyone that we have a practice here of

1768
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:22,800
everyone that we have a practice here of
 

1769
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,030
everyone that we have a practice here of
one teacher and an aid in every single

1770
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
one teacher and an aid in every single
 

1771
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,430
one teacher and an aid in every single
classroom. So there are two adults for

1772
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
classroom. So there are two adults for
 

1773
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,309
classroom. So there are two adults for
every 22 students. I will say that u

1774
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:30,319
every 22 students. I will say that u
 

1775
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,990
every 22 students. I will say that u
because of the enrollments that came to

1776
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000
because of the enrollments that came to
 

1777
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,390
because of the enrollments that came to
us late in the year, there are numbers

1778
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,400
us late in the year, there are numbers
 

1779
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,710
us late in the year, there are numbers
of classrooms at our kindergarten that

1780
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:36,720
of classrooms at our kindergarten that
 

1781
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,390
of classrooms at our kindergarten that
went as high as 23. We uh took a close

1782
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:40,400
went as high as 23. We uh took a close
 

1783
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,550
went as high as 23. We uh took a close
look at that. We are monitoring as we as

1784
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
look at that. We are monitoring as we as
 

1785
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,950
look at that. We are monitoring as we as
we go along where the need and support

1786
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:44,960
we go along where the need and support
 

1787
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,270
we go along where the need and support
may be may be needed. And I can assure

1788
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
may be may be needed. And I can assure
 

1789
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,190
may be may be needed. And I can assure
the community that where and when we

1793
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,510
find that need, we will meet that need.
Um, but at the end of the day, that's

1794
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
Um, but at the end of the day, that's
 

1795
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,670
Um, but at the end of the day, that's
the way our numbers break down and I

1796
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
the way our numbers break down and I

little bit down.
 

1811
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,750

Um, did we have a weight list this year

1812
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:13,760
Um, did we have a weight list this year
 

1813
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,470
Um, did we have a weight list this year
or

1814
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:14,480
or
 

1815
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,790
or
We did not. We did not have a wait list.

1816
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
We did not. We did not have a wait list.
 

1817
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,630
We did not. We did not have a wait list.
While I can't say I know this for a fact

1818
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:18,640
While I can't say I know this for a fact
 

1819
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,150
While I can't say I know this for a fact
because I don't have the hard data, but

1820
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
because I don't have the hard data, but
 

1821
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,990
because I don't have the hard data, but
what what we hear and what we what we

1822
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,000
what what we hear and what we what we
 

1823
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,950
what what we hear and what we what we
believe is that we have many many more

1824
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:24,960
believe is that we have many many more
 

1825
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,750
believe is that we have many many more
um double working families. Um so the

1826
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
um double working families. Um so the
 

1827
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,710
um double working families. Um so the
the hours that our prek provides is just

1828
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
the hours that our prek provides is just
 

1829
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,030
the hours that our prek provides is just
not enough for a good majority of our of

1830
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,040
not enough for a good majority of our of
 

1831
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,030
not enough for a good majority of our of
our parents. So they do have to choose

1832
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
our parents. So they do have to choose
 

1833
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,870
our parents. So they do have to choose
an alternative where they have a longer

1834
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
an alternative where they have a longer
 

1835
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,950
an alternative where they have a longer
day.

1836
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
day.
 

1837
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,550
day.
Okay. Thank you.

1838
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560
Okay. Thank you.
 

1839
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,390
Okay. Thank you.

1840
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
But I will say Dr. Anthony, I did feel a
 

1841
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,870
But I will say Dr. Anthony, I did feel a
question about when does registration in

1842
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
question about when does registration in
 

1843
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,670
question about when does registration in
school and I say we're open, you know,

school and I say we're open, you know,
 

1845
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,870
school and I say we're open, you know,
for the entire school year. So, it's 365

1846
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
for the entire school year. So, it's 365
 

1847
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,990
for the entire school year. So, it's 365
days on registrations. We get uh kids

1848
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,000
days on registrations. We get uh kids

days on registrations. We get uh kids
coming into our district the week or two

1850
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
coming into our district the week or two
 

1851
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,550
coming into our district the week or two
before and a month later. So, it's it's

1852
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:58,560
before and a month later. So, it's it's
 

1853
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,230
before and a month later. So, it's it's
a little bit hard on doing it, but I

1854
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,240
a little bit hard on doing it, but I
 

1855
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,230
a little bit hard on doing it, but I
know we're doing a good job on trying to

1856
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,240
know we're doing a good job on trying to
 

1857
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,309
know we're doing a good job on trying to
to manage the numbers that we do get the

1858
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:04,319
to manage the numbers that we do get the
 

1859
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,790
to manage the numbers that we do get the
last

1860
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
last
 

1861
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,470
last
we we changed the process a couple of

1862
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:06,480
we we changed the process a couple of
 

1863
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,710
we we changed the process a couple of
years ago. remember it used to be that

1864
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:08,720
years ago. remember it used to be that
 

1865
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,550
years ago. remember it used to be that
teachers were parents were told who the

1866
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:10,560
teachers were parents were told who the
 

1867
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,990
teachers were parents were told who the
teachers were going to be for the

1868
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,000
teachers were going to be for the
 

1869
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,750
teachers were going to be for the
upcoming school year in June when they

1870
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
upcoming school year in June when they
 

1871
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,470
upcoming school year in June when they
actually left. Um and um that caused

1872
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,480
actually left. Um and um that caused
 

1873
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,390
actually left. Um and um that caused
real havoc because we do have a lot of

1874
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
real havoc because we do have a lot of
 

1875
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,190
real havoc because we do have a lot of
in andout numbers over the course of of

1876
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:21,200
in andout numbers over the course of of
 

1877
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,510
in andout numbers over the course of of
the summer. Um so we made a commitment

1878
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
the summer. Um so we made a commitment
 

1879
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,750
the summer. Um so we made a commitment
that we would wait till a certain uh

1880
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:25,760
that we would wait till a certain uh
 

1881
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,030
that we would wait till a certain uh
date. Parents are notified as close to a

1882
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,040
date. Parents are notified as close to a
 

1883
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,910
date. Parents are notified as close to a
week before school um when um who the

1884
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920
week before school um when um who the
 

1885
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,829
week before school um when um who the
teachers actually are. And of course by

1886
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
teachers actually are. And of course by
 

1887
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,589
teachers actually are. And of course by
that point the teachers and are hired

1888
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:35,599
that point the teachers and are hired
 

1889
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,670
that point the teachers and are hired
and you we we try to hire the best of

1890
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
and you we we try to hire the best of
 

1891
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,870
and you we we try to hire the best of
the best obviously. Um so it becomes

1892
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
the best obviously. Um so it becomes
 

1893
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,950
the best obviously. Um so it becomes
much much harder the latter part of

1894
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
much much harder the latter part of
 

1895
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,190
much much harder the latter part of
August to hire what we believe is a

1896
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
August to hire what we believe is a
 

1897
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,950
August to hire what we believe is a
standard for Oceanside in terms of the

1898
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:46,960
standard for Oceanside in terms of the
 

1899
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,790
standard for Oceanside in terms of the
teaching staff. So, we stick to that

1900
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:48,800
teaching staff. So, we stick to that
 

1901
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,109
teaching staff. So, we stick to that
deadline, but once those names of the

1902
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:51,119
deadline, but once those names of the
 

1903
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,109
deadline, but once those names of the
teachers go out, unless there was a

1904
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:53,119
teachers go out, unless there was a
 

1905
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,670
teachers go out, unless there was a
tremendously dramatic uh shift in

1906
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
tremendously dramatic uh shift in
 

1907
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,230
tremendously dramatic uh shift in
numbers, which is unlikely, uh we we

1908
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:58,240
numbers, which is unlikely, uh we we
 

1909
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,150
numbers, which is unlikely, uh we we
stick to the the decisions that were

1910
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,160
stick to the the decisions that were
 

1911
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,069
stick to the the decisions that were
made at the time that the teachers were

1912
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
made at the time that the teachers were
 

1913
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,470
made at the time that the teachers were
announced.

Okay. And then my other question is, did
 

1947
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,069
Okay. And then my other question is, did
the state give us any new money at all

1948
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079
the state give us any new money at all
 

1949
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:40,550
the state give us any new money at all
this year?

1950
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:40,560
this year?
 

1951
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,190
this year?
Not this year. Um, obviously we're we

1952
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,200
Not this year. Um, obviously we're we
 

1953
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,630
Not this year. Um, obviously we're we
believe that there's a true commitment

1954
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
believe that there's a true commitment
 

1955
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,790
believe that there's a true commitment
to early childhood education. I also

1956
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:46,800
to early childhood education. I also
 

1957
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,550
to early childhood education. I also
believe the state is collecting data

1958
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:48,560
believe the state is collecting data
 

1959
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,950
believe the state is collecting data
that they're asking from us on on on the

1960
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:50,960
that they're asking from us on on on the
 

1961
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,950
that they're asking from us on on on the
results of that and I think we have some

1962
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:52,960
results of that and I think we have some
 

1963
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,190
results of that and I think we have some
really clear evidence that our students

1964
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,200
really clear evidence that our students
 

1965
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,589
really clear evidence that our students
who have attended UPK particularly in

1966
00:44:57,589 --> 00:44:57,599
who have attended UPK particularly in
 

1967
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,430
who have attended UPK particularly in
Oceanside who then come to our

1968
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
Oceanside who then come to our
 

1969
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,030
Oceanside who then come to our
kindergarten um are certainly um well um

1970
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
kindergarten um are certainly um well um
 

1971
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,870
kindergarten um are certainly um well um
prepared for kindergarten and and

1972
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
prepared for kindergarten and and
 

1973
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,710
prepared for kindergarten and and
beyond. So I believe the state is

1974
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:06,720
beyond. So I believe the state is
 

1975
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,390
beyond. So I believe the state is
gathering that data and once they have

1976
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
gathering that data and once they have
 

1977
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,230
gathering that data and once they have
all of that I do believe that the the

1978
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
all of that I do believe that the the
 

1979
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,270
all of that I do believe that the the
resources would be there to increase

1980
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
resources would be there to increase
 

1981
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,270
resources would be there to increase
even you know the aotment and we have

1982
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:15,280
even you know the aotment and we have
 

1983
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,430
even you know the aotment and we have
the space for it and as Dr. Kley

1984
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
the space for it and as Dr. Kley
 

1985
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,630
the space for it and as Dr. Kley
mentioned earlier building the

1986
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:18,640
mentioned earlier building the
 

1987
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,550
mentioned earlier building the
additional classrooms so we have the

1988
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,560
additional classrooms so we have the
 

1989
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,630
additional classrooms so we have the
space we're very very fortunate that's

1990
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,640
space we're very very fortunate that's
 

1991
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,430
space we're very very fortunate that's
really not the case in most districts. I

1992
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
really not the case in most districts. I
 

1993
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,430
really not the case in most districts. I
know that they had allocated us money

1994
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:27,440
know that they had allocated us money
 

1995
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,710
know that they had allocated us money
based on um well I know they

1996
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
based on um well I know they
 

1997
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,990
based on um well I know they
accommodated 285 seats last year but the

1998
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
accommodated 285 seats last year but the
 

1999
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,430
accommodated 285 seats last year but the
money that they give us this year is

2000
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,440
money that they give us this year is
 

2001
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,190
money that they give us this year is
going to be based on 273.

2002
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
going to be based on 273.
 

2003
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,190
going to be based on 273.
No no no no that that's not the way

2004
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:39,200
No no no no that that's not the way
 

2005
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,550
No no no no that that's not the way
it's still the same pool of money.

2006
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:40,560
it's still the same pool of money.
 

2007
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,710
it's still the same pool of money.
Correct. And it was 287 that they they

2008
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:42,720
Correct. And it was 287 that they they
 

2009
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,030
Correct. And it was 287 that they they
allowed us last year and it was 287 this

2010
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
allowed us last year and it was 287 this
 

2011
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:45,270
allowed us last year and it was 287 this
year.

2012
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,280
year.
 

2013
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,750
year.
So they don't reduce the pool unless the

2014
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
So they don't reduce the pool unless the
 

2015
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,990
So they don't reduce the pool unless the
money unless the money goes elsewhere. I

2016
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,000
money unless the money goes elsewhere. I
 

2017
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,550
money unless the money goes elsewhere. I
can't speak for that, but barring the

2018
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
can't speak for that, but barring the
 

2019
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,550
can't speak for that, but barring the
fact that it's unlikely we would have at

2020
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:54,560
fact that it's unlikely we would have at
 

2021
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,550
fact that it's unlikely we would have at
least 287, of course, we're hoping for

2022
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
least 287, of course, we're hoping for
 

2023
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,030
least 287, of course, we're hoping for
more.

2024
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,040
more.
 

2025
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,349
more.
And we're also hoping for some realistic

2026
00:45:59,349 --> 00:45:59,359
And we're also hoping for some realistic
 

2027
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,870
And we're also hoping for some realistic
inflationary increases, too.

2028
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:00,880
inflationary increases, too.
 

2029
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,750
inflationary increases, too.
Correct. Correct.

2030
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:01,760
Correct. Correct.
 

2031
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,589
Correct. Correct.
Okay. Um, and then I have another

2032
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:03,599
Okay. Um, and then I have another
 

2033
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,349
Okay. Um, and then I have another
question for you, and I just want to get

2034
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:05,359
question for you, and I just want to get
 

2035
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,670
question for you, and I just want to get
back down here to the actual elementary

2036
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:07,680
back down here to the actual elementary
 

2037
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,750
back down here to the actual elementary
enrollment by building.

2038
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
enrollment by building.
 

2039
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,390
enrollment by building.
Correct.

2040
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,400
Correct.
 

2041
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,430
Correct.
And down to the kindergarten. Um, the to

2042
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
And down to the kindergarten. Um, the to
 

2043
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,589
And down to the kindergarten. Um, the to
me it seems like a very large number for

2044
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:15,599
me it seems like a very large number for
 

2045
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,349
me it seems like a very large number for
school three and school eight

2046
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:17,359
school three and school eight
 

2047
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,270
school three and school eight
in kindergarten. um are we going to

2048
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
in kindergarten. um are we going to
 

2049
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,109
in kindergarten. um are we going to
we're preparing for that for next year

2050
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:23,119
we're preparing for that for next year
 

2051
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:23,670
we're preparing for that for next year
as they go

2052
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
as they go
 

2053
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,829
as they go
those numbers. So the what what you're

2054
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:25,839
those numbers. So the what what you're
 

2055
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,750
those numbers. So the what what you're
pointing out so if you look at where it

2056
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:27,760
pointing out so if you look at where it
 

2057
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,589
pointing out so if you look at where it
says kindergarten we do track by home

2058
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:29,599
says kindergarten we do track by home
 

2059
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,510
says kindergarten we do track by home
school we don't place kids but we track

2060
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,520
school we don't place kids but we track
 

2061
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,069
school we don't place kids but we track
it to to see where long-term where the

2062
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:34,079
it to to see where long-term where the
 

2063
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,630
it to to see where long-term where the
trends are going to be and those trends

2064
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:36,640
trends are going to be and those trends
 

2065
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,470
trends are going to be and those trends
with school three and definitely school

2066
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
with school three and definitely school
 

2067
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,030
with school three and definitely school
eight being the highest um are are

2068
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
eight being the highest um are are
 

2069
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,470
eight being the highest um are are
consistent with what the enrollment

2070
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:42,480
consistent with what the enrollment
 

2071
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,309
consistent with what the enrollment
study has said. So we we have that

2072
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,319
study has said. So we we have that
 

2073
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:44,710
study has said. So we we have that
prepared.

2074
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:44,720
prepared.
 

2075
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,069
prepared.
So we're prepared. I guess my question

2076
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
So we're prepared. I guess my question
 

2077
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,910
So we're prepared. I guess my question
is are we prepared for that at school

2078
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:47,920
is are we prepared for that at school
 

2079
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,630
is are we prepared for that at school
three and school eight uh when they move

2080
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:50,640
three and school eight uh when they move
 

2081
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,990
three and school eight uh when they move
first grade next year?

2082
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,000
first grade next year?
 

2083
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,550
first grade next year?
Those those numbers are are are

2084
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:54,560
Those those numbers are are are
 

2085
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,790
Those those numbers are are are
consistent with what again the

2086
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
consistent with what again the
 

2087
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,550
consistent with what again the
enrollment study said. But yes, if you

2088
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
enrollment study said. But yes, if you
 

2089
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,790
enrollment study said. But yes, if you
look at school 8 grade one this year is

2090
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:00,800
look at school 8 grade one this year is
 

2091
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,550
look at school 8 grade one this year is
only 60 kids. If all of these

2092
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:02,560
only 60 kids. If all of these
 

2093
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,550
only 60 kids. If all of these
kindergarten students remain with us

2094
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,560
kindergarten students remain with us
 

2095
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,390
kindergarten students remain with us
that's that will be a big shift and then

2096
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:06,400
that's that will be a big shift and then
 

2097
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,270
that's that will be a big shift and then
we will increase at the appropriate time

2098
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
we will increase at the appropriate time
 

2099
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,030
we will increase at the appropriate time
the number of sections. So the answer is

2100
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,040
the number of sections. So the answer is
 

2101
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,790
the number of sections. So the answer is
even school school five is on the high

2102
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
even school school five is on the high
 

2103
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,670
even school school five is on the high
end of

2104
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:13,680
